# Features ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  **Save Sketches During Reload:** Implemented browser storages to save the progress of the sketch he's creating, so that when you reload the page, the sketch will be the same as before.
2.  **Built for Performace:** Implemented all industry-grade best practices like Rate Limiting, Max Login Attempts, Search, Infinite Queries and more so that it can easily scale to a large number of users.
3.  **Monitoring & Logging:** Used a variety of tools to ensure Logging, Monitoring and sending error Reports through different notification channels for easy troubleshooting.
4.  **Upcoming:** I'm planning to integrate AI to generate realistic images from user sketches, but it will be a premium feature.
